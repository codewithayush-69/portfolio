        My name is Ayush Maurya, a passionate self-taught web developer from
        Khojapur, a small village in Phulpur, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India.
        <br />
        <br />
        I completed my 12th with average marks, but from a young age, I’ve
        always had a deep interest in computers, mobile phones, and technology.
        I was the kind of person who wanted to understand how things work behind
        the screen, not just use them. This curiosity slowly turned into a
        serious passion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although I started a BSc Agriculture degree, I soon realized my true
        calling was in technology and development. With limited financial
        resources and distance from colleges, I made the bold decision to take a
        drop and start learning web development on my own. In just four months,
        I’ve worked hard every single day to learn the front-end side of web
        development — mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap, and
        Tailwind CSS. I didn’t just study these technologies — I built small
        projects with them, made mistakes, learned from them, and grew stronger.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from coding, I also help manage my father’s small footwear shop in
        my town. As the eldest son in the family, I have responsibilities at
        home, but that never stops me from chasing my dreams. I balance
        household work, shop duties, and my learning schedule — all with
        dedication and purpose. Every line of code I write is a step toward
        building a better future not just for me, but for my family as well.
        <br />
        <br />I may not have a formal degree or a fancy background, but what I
        do have is passion, consistency, and a mindset that refuses to give up.
        This portfolio is not just a collection of my work — it’s a reflection
        of my journey, my growth, and my dream of becoming a skilled MERN stack
        developer one day. I'm learning every day, and I believe that with focus
        and effort, anything is possible.
